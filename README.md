## About Me 💫

👩‍💻 I am a self-taught data scientist who has been working in the blockchain industry for over 4 years. While working at a blockchain analytics firm as an analyst, I had opportunities to collaborate with data scientists and engineers on different projects from building trading strategies to predictive analytics. Naturally, I shifted toward data science and learned how to code in Python. 

📈 I am a CAIA, so the datasets I play with are mainly financial data such as price, volume and market indicators. I enjoyed coding in Python as this language makes it easy to work with statistics which I often adopt to provide insights.
